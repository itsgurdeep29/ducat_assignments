    <h3>Dessert</h3>
    <li><b>Cakes:- Perhaps the most popular dessert of all time, cake contains a combination of flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, leavening agents (such as yeast or baking powder), and sometimes milk or water. Itâ€™s topped with sweet and creamy icing for the ultimate treat.</b></li><br>

    <li><b>Cookies:- Made from flour and sugar, cookies are usually small, flat, and round. To create sandwich cookies, just place a small amount of jam or icing in the middle of two cookies. Cookies can also be cut in elaborate shapes, perfect for different seasons and events. </li><br>
   
        <li><b> Custards and Puddings:- Made with a base of cream and milk, puddings and custards are remarkably similar. However, puddings are thickened with starches such as corn starch or tapioca, while custards are thickened using only eggs.</b></li><br>
