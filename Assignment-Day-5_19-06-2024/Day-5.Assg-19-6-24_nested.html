            <li>A recipe definition contains a list of variables and 1 or several recipes (value sets) for these variables. You can save a recipe to a file or write recipe files to the controller. By using different recipes, you can assign another set of values to a set of variables on the controller in one stroke.</li><br>
            <li>
                Recipes are basically instructions; receipts are a record of what has been received as part of a transaction. Both recipe and receipt derive from recipere, the Latin verb meaning "to receive or take," with receipt adding a detour through Old North French and Middle English.
