    <h3>Upcoming Events</h3>
    <h4>Wedding</h4>
    <li><b>Mangni, 25/06/2024:- The mangni (as it is called in northern India) or nischitartham (as it's referred to in
            southern India) is the closest event to a Western engagement party. This event is often large and
            celebratory with all of the two partners' families present. At this party, several rituals are performed, a
            formal commitment is made between the two people getting engaged, and vows are exchanged to solidify the
            engagement.</b></li><br>
    <li><b>Laghan Patrika, 27/06/2024:- The to-be-weds also participate in lagna patrika, which is when the bride and
            groom exchange a written vow to one another that the wedding will take place at a later date and time.
            Typically, the date and time proposed during this ceremony will be the one printed on the invitations.
            Often, a pandit (Hindu priest) will be present to write down the details of the marriage, including the
            names of the engaged, their family members, and the proposed date and time of the wedding, with a red pen.
            Together, the wagdaan and lagna patrika are considered a formal announcement of the wedding, which will
            typically take place months later.</li><br>
    <li><b>Mehndi Party, 28/06/2024:- A mehndi ceremony is traditionally reserved for the bride-to-be and her closest
            friends and family members. The main purpose of this event is the application of bridal mehndi, or henna
            design, to her hands and feet. Henna is a brown paste that temporarily dyes the skin and is applied in
            intricate designs. The ceremony usually takes place the day before the wedding, as the henna application can
            take a while and requires the bride to remain seated for hours while it dries.
            <br><br>
            Traditionally, the designs have an ornamental floral theme, but contemporary brides-to-be opt for personal
            touches or even hide the groom's name within the design and have him try to find it. "A modern addition to
            this tradition is to customize the henna designs with something personal that means something to the
            couple," says Patel. "Some that I have seen and love are the coupleâ€™s own faces and a skyline of the city in
            which they met." Some believe that the darker the color of the dried design or the longer that it lasts on
            the skin before fading signifies how deep the groom's love is or how fondly the mother-in-law will treat her
            son's spouse.</b></li><br>
    <li><b>Tilak Ceremony, 29/06/2024:- Consider the tilak ceremony the groom's counterpart to the mehndi ceremony. As
            you may have guessed, this ceremony is only for the groom-to-be and family members or close friends. During
            the ceremony, the bride's father and groom's father exchange gifts, such as sugar, coconuts, rice, clothes,
            jewelry, and henna. The groom-to-be is offered tilak, a paste painted onto the forehead, to ensure he will
            be a loving husband and father. The exchanging of gifts and the application of tilak at this ceremony are
            meant to symbolize the bride's father's acceptance of the groom into his family.</b></li><br>
