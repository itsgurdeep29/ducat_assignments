    <h2><strong>Question 10: Build a Non-Profit Website:</strong></h2>
    <h3>Project</h3>
    <li><b>In a nutshell, a project manager is responsible for the oversight of key projects and campaigns at a non-profit organisation. This covers everything from planning to initiating, designing, executing and monitoring the life cycle of a project.</b></li><br>

    <h3>Donate</h3>
    <li><b>A charitable donation is a gift of cash or property made to a nonprofit organization to help it accomplish its goals, for which the donor receives nothing of value in return. In the U.S., donations can be deducted from the federal tax returns of individuals and companies making them.
    </b></li><br>
    <li><b>To donate means to give something — money, goods, or time — to some cause, such as a charity. The word has a more altruistic meaning than does simply "giving"; it suggests that you don't expect anything in return for the contribution.</b></li><br>
