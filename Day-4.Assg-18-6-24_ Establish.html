    <h2><strong>Question 6: Establish a Knowledge Base:</strong></h2>
    <h3>Science</h3>
    <li><b> knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as
            obtained and tested through scientific method. b. : such knowledge or such a system of knowledge concerned
            with the physical world and its phenomena : natural science By working at the intersection of science,
            technology and health for more than a decade, the company has developed medicines at unprecedented speed and
            efficiency, including one of the earliest and most effective COVID-19 vaccines.
            <br><br>
            Science is a rigorous, systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable
            explanations and predictions about the world.[1][2] Modern science is typically divided into three major
            branches:[3] the natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology), which study the physical world;
            the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and
            societies;[4][5] and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which
            study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.[6][7] There is disagreement whether the formal sciences
            are science disciplines,[8][9][10] as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[11][9] Applied sciences are
            disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and
            medicine.[12][13][14]
            <br><br The history of science spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest written
                records of identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to Bronze Age Egypt and Mesopotamia from
                around 3000 to 1200 BCE. Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped
                the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide
                explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes, while further advancements,
                including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the Golden Age of
                India.[15]: 12 [16][17][18] Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the
                Western Roman Empire during the Early Middle Ages (400 to 1000 CE), but in the Medieval renaissances
                (Carolingian Renaissance, Ottonian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century) scholarship
                flourished again. Some Greek manuscripts lost in Western Europe were preserved and expanded upon in the
                Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age,[19] along with the later efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars
                who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe at the start of the
                Renaissance.</b></li><br>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <li><b>Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping
            infectious and toxic materials away from the body. It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or
            facilitate navigation in varied environments. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation.
        </b></li><br>
    <li><b>Clothing has significant social factors as well. Wearing clothes is a variable social norm. It may connote
            modesty. Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing. In many parts of the world, not
            wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breast, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent
            exposure. Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally
            and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs. Clothing also may be used to
            communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism.
            <br><br>
            Some forms of personal protective equipment amount to clothing, such as coveralls, chaps or a doctor's white
            coat, with similar requirements for maintenance and cleaning as other textiles (boxing gloves function both
            as protective equipment and as a sparring weapon, so the equipment aspect rises above the glove aspect).
            More specialized forms of protective equipment, such as face shields are classified as protective
            accessories. At the far extreme, self-enclosing diving suits or space suits are form-fitting body covers,
            and amount to a form of dress, without being clothing per se, while containing enough high technology to
            amount to more of a tool than a garment. This line will continue to blur as wearable technology embeds
            assistive devices directly into the fabric itself; the enabling innovations are ultra low power consumption
            and flexible electronic substrates.
            <br><br>
            Clothing also hybridizes into a personal transportation system (ice skates, roller skates, cargo pants,
            other outdoor survival gear, one-man band) or concealment system (stage magicians, hidden linings or pockets
            in tradecraft, integrated holsters for concealed carry, merchandise-laden trench coats on the black market —
            where the purpose of the clothing often carries over into disguise). A mode of dress fit to purpose, whether
            stylistic or functional, is known as an outfit or ensemble.</b></li><br>
    <h3>History</h3>        
            <li><b>The history of science itself developed as a discipline in Europe and North America during the late 19th century, as a way of charting the rise of a distinctively modern world under European domination. Science seemed uniquely a product of the white men in the west.</b></li><br>
